# 🏃‍♀️ Fitness Tracker Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes user activity data collected by a fitness tracker. The goal is to uncover behavioral patterns and generate health-related insights based on steps taken, calories burned, and active minutes. The analysis supports better understanding of user engagement and potential strategies for promoting healthier habits.

## 📊 Data Sources

The dataset contains user-level activity records with the following fields:

- `Steps`: Number of steps taken per day  
- `Calories`: Calories burned per day  
- `VeryActiveMinutes`: Time spent in very active physical activity per day  
- `SedentaryMinutes`: Time spent inactive  
- `TotalMinutesAsleep`: Sleep duration

## 🔍 Key Steps

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preparation 🧹  
- Imported and reviewed raw activity data  
- Handled missing values and formatting issues  
- Converted dates to time series format for analysis  

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📊  
- Analyzed distributions of steps, calories, and activity levels  
- Visualized correlations between variables using histograms and scatter plots  
- Identified outliers and behavioral patterns among user groups  

### 3️⃣ Insight Generation & Segmentation 🧠  
- Compared activity patterns by user type (sedentary vs. active)  
- Explored the relationship between physical activity and calorie expenditure  
- Identified peak activity hours and differences across days
